Here, we will turn  `windmill.jpg`  into an animated image. Here is that image:

![windmill](windmill.jpg)

First, we will create a vector image Inkscape. You can see that file in this
repo (`windmill.svg`).

I then exported some `.png` images to manipulate in the browser. See
`index.html`, `index.css` (and maybe `index.js`) for the web programming stuff.

I found that the blades were spinning the wrong way. So rather than change
the animation scripting, I just flipped the blades image, lol.

[This thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16771225/css3-rotate-animation) on 
Stack Overflow helped me with the animation.
